Experienced Mod for Minecraft

This mod has been put on hold for a while!

This is a Minecraft mod used to help players store their experience levels into various different ways.

The plans for the mod will also use experience as a way to further in the mod; just like a magic mod but using experience instead.

Following ways to store experience:

Experience Book

This book gives the player the ability to store around 15 levels (315 experience points) and can be stored away for safe keeping. Right clicking while holding the book will put experience in, and sneak right clicking will take the experience out. Each one level at a time.

Experience Blocks

There are 3+1 experience blocks the mod provides. Each with different tiers that dictate how much experience can be placed into the block. Comes with a UI that shows how much experience is stored in the block, an area that will be used for recipes, an area for the experience book to drain the experience from it, and buttons for adding/taking experience from the player.

In the future, I would like the mod to offer some way to utilise experience in a way that might seem beneficial. And a new experience type will also be great to work with.
